App Idea
* An app that displays movies

MVP
* Users should see a page with 20 movies by default
* Users should be able to search for their favorite movies by movie's name 

Stretch
* Users should be able to search by key words and get the result of movies that have that key word in their title
* Users should be able to see an image and the title below the image for each movie desplayed there
