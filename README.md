Learning Goals
Design and architect features across frontend
Communicate and collaborate in a technical environment
Debug issues in small- to medium-sized projects
Build and iterate on a project MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
Introduction
Welcome to JavaScript Project Mode!

For this project, you're going build a Single Page Application (SPA). Building this application will be challenging because it will integrate everything you've learned up to this point. Your frontend will be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will communicate with a public API.

This is a really exciting moment - the whole course up until this point is coming together!

Project Requirements
Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.

Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.

Your project's DOM Manipulation should be well structured, following the pattern of creating reusable components and appending them to the DOM.
Strategy, Timeline, and Tips
Planning
Plan out your features
Develop user stories
Features should not need you there to explain them to users
Explore your API's data
Feedback
Get feedback from instructors before you start to build
Your API
Your App Idea
Your App Features
Get feedback from your peers as you build each feature. This will help identify bugs and design improvements
Get feedback on your code from instructors as you build
MVP ASAP
Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) as quickly as possible.
Pick an API and explore it early on to ensure it will work for your needs
Divide your features into MVP and Stretch Goals
Make it work. Make it right. Make it fast. In that order.

Instructor Guidance
You should strive to solve problems independently, but you also shouldn't waste your time stuck on a problem. A good guideline for a small bug is the rule of 10s:

10 minutes debugging the code
10 minutes using Google and StackOverflow to try to find an answer
10 minutes asking your teammates or fellow students for help
Asking an instructor
If you seek out instructor guidance on your design from the start, they might help steer you into design and architectural decisions that will help you down the road. That will also give the instructors context for what your app is supposed to do, so you won't need to explain everything to them when asking for help debugging.

Guidelines for Staying Organized
Write down the decisions you make about your project. This will not only help you think more clearly, it will also help you communicate your project to instructors when asking for help. In addition to writing everything down, we also recommend the following to help stay organized and on track:

Describe/sketch your ideas (use diagrams!).
Start by creating a frontend directory with the basic files you'll need
Next, build enough code to get some API data to work with. Don't worry about building all of your async code yet, just get to the point where you can access one endpoint on an API, then start working on getting that data displayed.
Then, continue to build additional async code and frontend features.
Continue building features one by one.
Check in with your instructors to make sure your scope and timeline are manageable.
